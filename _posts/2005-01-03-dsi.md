description: Lighting fast makeovers were the specialty of Don't Sweat It.  Two days from the time we drove up to the time we drove away. Full bathroom or Kitchen in two days?  Sure, why the hell not.  We were the first show to be "bleeped" on HGTV, so I'm pretty proud of that.
episodes: 120 episodes over 9 seasons
