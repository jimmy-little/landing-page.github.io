description: Touring with Broadway shows is a sometimes-full-time gig that I've been doing off and on for over 15 years. The list is varied. Annie, Jekyll & Hyde, Cinderella, Cabaret, Seussical The Musical, Bombay Dreams, Movin' Out, High School Musical 2, Dr. Dolittle, Peter Pan.  | I've also worked on a few shows that didn't tour... The Pirate Queen, Tarzan, Carrie, Footloose, Anything Goes. | My favorite shows to do are the shows where I'm a flyguy.  Seussical, Dolittle, Tarzan, Carrie, The Pirate Queen, and Peter Pan.
